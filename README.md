# Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of a BERT-based model to classify news articles into different categories. BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a state-of-the-art model for NLP tasks. The goal of this project is to accurately predict the category of a news article based on its content.

Key Features

Dataset: A news dataset containing thousands of articles, which are categorized into different sections.

Text Encoding: The text data is tokenized using the BertTokenizer from Hugging Face's transformers library, ensuring that the model can process and understand the input text efficiently.

Model Training: The BERT model is fine-tuned using the tokenized news data, allowing it to learn the nuances of each category.

Datasets: The project splits the dataset into training, validation, and test sets, with proper encoding for inputs like attention masks and input IDs.

Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated on its ability to classify unseen news articles into the correct categories. 

*Steps*

Preprocessing: News articles are cleaned and tokenized. The tokenizer used is BERTâ€™s uncased version, which helps in reducing complexity by ignoring case distinctions.

Model Training: The preprocessed data is fed into the BERT model for training. It learns from the articles and their respective categories.

Testing: The trained model is evaluated on the test dataset to check its performance and accuracy in categorizing news articles.
