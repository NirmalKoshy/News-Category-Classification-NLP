# News-Category-Classification-NLP
 In this project from a hackathon, we leveraged NLP to categorize news articles into Politics, Technology, Entertainment, and Business. We trained a model on 7,628 articles and tested it on 2,748. This system aims to help readers quickly find relevant information, making it easier to access the topics they care about.
